These categories include grocery and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, retail & recreation, residential and workplaces."},{"type":"text","value":"This map shows the data for just one category, parks. Google's definition of parks includes local and national parks as well as public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens."},{"type":"text","value":"A red spike on the map indicates an increase in visits and length of stay at this location whereas a blue spike indicates a decrease, relative to a baseline value.

This is to be expected since parks will naturally see high fluctuations in their usage depending on the seasons or local public holidays. For instance, I might spend all day in the park if there is nice weather on a bank holiday weekend but I will visit the office five days a week all year regardless of the weather."},{"type":"text","value":"The use of parks is also highly dependent on their location.
